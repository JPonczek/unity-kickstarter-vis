unity-kickstarter-vis
=====================

Visualizing kickstarter using the Unity 3D video game engine

This was an in progress prototype. There is a lot of code that no longer used, and there is lot of duplicated code. Deal with it.

####Quick start
Load the CityBuild scene file in the Assets/Scenes folder. Run.

####Some notes
* Made with Unity 3.6. I don't have any reason to believe it won't work with 4.0+
* You're probably better off running in offline mode, but there is code to connect to an api, which is part of the [django-kickstarter-scraper](https://github.com/neight-allen/django-kickstarter-scraper) and leverages [tastypie](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie)
* I have a build working on iPad, and it should mostly work if you change the build type to iOS. I wanted to get it working on an android tablet as well, but didn't start that project.
* There's also code for it to work with a Rockband xbox 360 controller. That was fun.
* If you don't have Unity Pro, you might be better off with [the unitypackage](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx11M2JmRNl5OUdWSWV6TUVLc2M/edit?usp=sharing)
